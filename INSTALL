2.Web-based installation 

2.1 Download the archive and decompress it somewhere in the webroot path of your webserver:

      tar -xzf phpMyTicket.tar.gz
      
    This produces a directory called phpMyTicket - you can rename it.
    
2.2 Create new database using your mysql client, for example:

      mysqladmin create phpMyTicket
      
2.3 Browse to the installation script and follow instructions:

      http://[your-host]/phpMyTicket/index.php
      

4. Problems

There are some know problems because of various php configs.
Most of them can be solved by renaming _.htaccess file to .htaccess. 
But, sometimes, your web server is not instructed to read .htaccess
In this case you need to edit config file: includes/config/init_common.php

4.1 Gegister globals

For security reasons this php flag should be off. Install will produce a warning.
Renaming _.htaccess to .htaccess should solve this problem, otherwise edit
includes/config/init_common.php and remove those two lines:

		echo "Set register_globals to OFF please. Bye.";
		exit;

4.2 Safe mode

Directory creation problem can arise if you are in safe mode. In this case
edit includes/config/init_common.php and remove section at line 99. 
After install create missing folders by hand and allow php user to write into.

4.3 Blank screen

If you see a blank screen instead the install page you have too old php version 
and errors not displayed. Update to newer php version
